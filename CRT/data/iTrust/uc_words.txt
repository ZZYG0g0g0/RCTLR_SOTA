A row for showing the message subject , the name of the recipient , and the timestamp ( which includes both date and time ) is then visible in the patient/representative’s message outbox . A bolded row for showing the message subject , the name of sender , and the timestamp is then visible in the LHCP 's message inbox . A fake email is sent to the LHCP alerting the user that a new message has arrived . After a message is sent , the patient or personal representative is directed to his/her message outbox . [ S2 ] An LHCP chooses to send a message to a patient/representative ( no multiple recipients allowed in a single message ) . The LHCP enters and confirms the patient/representative 's MID [ E1 , E2 ] . The LHCP types the subject ( up to 100 characters ) and the text of a message ( up to 1000 characters ) , and clicks the send button .

A bolded row for showing the message subject ( now preceded by “RE : ” ) , the name of sender , and timestamp are then visible in the patient/representative’s message inbox . A fake email is sent to the patient/representative alerting the patient/representative that a new message reply has arrived . [ S5 ] A user ( a patient , patient representative , or LHCP ) wishes to read a message from the message inbox or outbox . The user chooses to open his or her message inbox/outbox . Each row in the message inbox/outbox includes the message subject , the name of either the sender ( only for the case of inbox ) or recipient ( only for the case of outbox ) , and timestamp . By default , the messages in the message inbox/outbox should be ordered by timestamp , the most recent first . Each row for an unread message in the message inbox is bolded . The user selects a message from the message inbox/outbox to read by clicking the “Read” link beside the row for the message , and then the message subject , the name of the sender , the name of the the recipient , timestamp , and the message text shall be displayed in a new page . After a message in the message inbox is read ( i.e. , displayed in a new page ) , the row for the message in the message inbox is not bolded anymore . [ S6 ] A user ( a patient , patient representative , or LHCP ) can sort messages in his or her message inbox by either the sender 's last name or timestamp ( but not both ) in either ascending or descending order ( where timestamps in descending order would have the most recent first ) . A user can sort messages in his or her message outbox by the recipient 's last name or timestamp ( but not both ) in either ascending or descending order . To do so , a user selects one option out of the “Sort by” labeled drop-down box ( with options of “Sender/Recipient” or “Timestamp” ) and selects one option out of the “by order of” labeled drop-down box ( with options of “ascending” or “descending” ) , and then click the “Sort” button .

Note that a single filter includes values for these five filtering criteria ( rather than five filters for these five filtering criteria ) and a value could be an empty string , indicating that this criterion has no impact on filtering ( i.e. , imposing no constraints related to this criterion ) . The user interface shall be initially populated with the values of the filtering criteria from the previously saved filter . After the user modifies the criteria , the user chooses to click the “Cancel” button to cancel the modifications of the filter ( i.e. , repopulate the user interface with the values of the filtering criteria from the previously saved filter ) , to click the “Test Search” button to search ( i.e. , displaying the message inbox [ S5 ] including only the messages satisfying the specified filtering criteria ) , or to click the “Save” button to save the modified filter .

[ S2 ] The patient list is titled with the HCP 's name . The patient list includes the patient 's name ( i.e. , first name and last name ) , phone number , and contact email address [ E1 ] ( so that confirmation calls or emails can be made or sent outside of the iTrust system ) . The list is sorted based on the ascending alphabetical order of the patients ' last names , and then first names . When a chronic special-diagnosis-history patient satisfies all three conditions and has multiple prescriptions satisfying the third condition , the patient is listed in the list only once .

The sending HCP is also presented with a text box to include notes about the referral . The sending HCP then chooses a priority from 1-3 ( 1 is most important , 3 is least important ) for the referral . The HCP may send the referral , cancel the referral , or edit the referral [ E2 ] . Upon sending a referral , the patient , sending HCP , and receiving HCP receive a message summarizing the newly created referral information ( sending HCP name & specialty , receiving HCP name & specialty , patient name , referral notes , and referral creation timestamp ) ; additionally , the sending and receiving HCP messages include the referral priority .
