1. You only need to run the app.py in each program, and you also need to place the dataset folder, CoreNLP folder, and related corpora into the directory of each program.
2. Due to GitHub's file size limits and privacy requirements during paper review, the corpora needed for training, CoreNLP libraries, and some large-scale datasets will be made publicly available through other means after the paper review.
3. For the code of TAROT and FTLR, we only provide the results of the runs. To respect the research achievements and copyrights of other researchers, please go to their code repositories to obtain the corresponding source code.
